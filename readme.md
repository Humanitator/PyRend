# PyRend
## The least efficient 3D renderer of all

This is a 3D renderer made in python, so don't expect high efficiency and other stuff like that
The renderer is made for learning 3D rendering basics and for rendering basic stuff
> Fun fact: I made this renderer beacause I needed a reason to learn python.
